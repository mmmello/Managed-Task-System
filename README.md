## Managed Task System

This system is the result of a project for the conclusion of the Structured Algorithms course and its objective is to manage, in a basic way, our day to day tasks.

### The system must have the functions of:

* Register a task.
* Show the registered tasks.
* Set a task to complete (If the task is already set to complete you can delete it or keep it in memory for your own records).
* Delete a task.
* Edit the title.
* Edit the description.
* Edit the completion date.
* On startup, read a persistence file in txt to allocate the previously generated data in memory.
* When exiting, you must save in the same txt file the data generated and/or modified during the program's execution.

### A task must have:

* Identifier
* Title
* Description
* Task Status
* Creation date
* Completion date
